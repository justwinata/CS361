[Program 3]
[Description]
We used the Huffman algorithm implemented at http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Huffman_coding#Java
We altered it slightly, extracting the main method and turning it into its own "execute" method.

[Progress]
We finished the most/half/one quarter of this assignment. There are some bugs in function/method A in XXX.java file. Some special test cases won't work, the reason is ... For YYY.java, we don't know how to implement the sort method.
