[Program 2]
There are 5 java files.In SecureSytem.java we implemented methods to check for CREATE, DESTROY, and RUN instructions. The CovertChannel is the most importatnt java file. In CovertChannel we implemented main to read two args and check wheter a "v" is present for the verbose. We then created Hal and Lyle subjects. We implemented a InputStream and OutputStream to convert a file to a ".out" file. To complie our program, you need to use "javac *.java". To run our program, you need to use "java SecureSystem *inputname" *one of the file names

[Finish]
We finished one quarter of this assignment.There are some problems with the scope of how we passed Instruction objects in our SecureSystem.java file. We were not sure how to inplemnt the reading of streamed bits over the channel. The whole process had us confused. The program compiles and runs and makes a log.txt and inputfilename.out, but not properly.
